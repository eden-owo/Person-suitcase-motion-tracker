# Instance Segmentation of People and Suitcases Using YOLOv11 and Custom C++ OpenCV Build


This repository showcases instance segmentation of people and suitcases using YOLOv11 models and a self-compiled OpenCV C++ library.

With calculating the velocity of people and suitcases, its primary goal is to detect any instances of falls involving either.

TensorRT is recommended for at least 30% faster computation.

| GPU | Model | With TensorRT (INT8) | Without TensorRT |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| GTX 1650 Laptop | Yolo11m-seg | 22 FPS | 16 FPS |
| RTX 4060 Laptop | Yolo11m-seg | 48 FPS | 32 FPS |
| Jetson orin nano super | Yolo11m-seg | 24 FPS | 12 FPS |

Flask is used for web-based visualization, as OpenCVâ€™s GTK interface is not supported in headless environments like Docker or Kubernetes.

The project structure is as follows, with a description of each module's functionality and purpose:


```text
